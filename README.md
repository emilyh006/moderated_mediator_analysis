Statisitical Replication as the Final Project for intro Computational Social Science Course



## Study Overview 
This project replicates the statistical analysis of a two-part social psychology study that explores the effects of ostracism on individual perceptions. Specifically, it examines whether:

1. Ostracism increases darkness judgment (the perception of darkness or negative emotions).
2. Meaningful existence serves as a mediator, explaining the relationship between ostracism and darkness judgment.
3. Self-compassion acts as a moderator, influencing the strength of ostracism's effect on feelings of meaningful existence.




## Project Overview 
In this project, I replicated the statistical analysis from the second study using R instead of SPSS, which was used in the original paper. This replication aims to confirm the findings and demonstrate the application of moderated mediation models with R.



### Resources

The data analysis in this project was performed following the instructions and examples provided in Washburn, A. N., Chapter 15: Moderated Mediation, available at [Ademos](https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter15.html). This chapter provided detailed guidance on implementing moderated mediation models in R.
